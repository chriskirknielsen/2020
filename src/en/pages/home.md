My name is **Christopher Kirk-Nielsen**, but you can call me **Chris**. I'm a designer-turned-developer who loves building for the web, working at MOJO PSG. I have an [about page](/about/) full of random things about me, if you're interested. I also have some [typefaces](/fonts) and [shirt/poster designs](/designs) that help me scratch that designer itch once in a while.

I enjoy writing sometimes; you can find my ramblings over on [the blog](/blog/), but your might want to subscribe to the [RSS feed](/rss.xml) since there is no schedule in place.**The latest things I wrote are here:**
