Well, he's a huge geek at heart. Let's dig a bit more, shall we? He makes electronica music as Chronoise. He loves synthwave and anything inspired by the '80s. He likes watching classic movies and television shows. When he has time, he enjoys playing video games in order to relax and venture into new worlds. If you're curious about what music he likes, he listens to a lot of rock and electronica. He fancies reading riveting books with a cup of tea. For over a decade, he has been using tools such as Photoshop and After Effects as well as languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. He has always been self-sufficient, but also a team player and a MacGyver-worthy problem solver (minus the hair). He lives in New York, but he was born in Lyon, France. In addition to English, he also speaks French and Danish and you can throw Italian his way, as well! (however, he has a strong aversion for addressing himself in the third person…)
