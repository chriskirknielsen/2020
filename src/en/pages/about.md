I'm a designer-turned-developer who loves working on websites. What started as a little side project in middle school became an eye-opening experience, a hobby that has stuck with me for over a decade. I've already learned a lot about front-end development, but there's always more to learn, which is why I cherish this field. Plus, I still get to flex my designer muscles here and there!

When I'm not doing web-related things, I might be making electronica music as [Chronoise](https://chronoise.com), or listening to some, mainly rock and synthwave (I'm infatuated with '80s aesthetics). I enjoy movies and T.V. shows, as well as video games, which I sometimes review on my blog, [Geekometric](https://geekometric.com). I also appreciate reading a nice book during my commute in New York City, but I'm originally from Lyon, in France. I speak English, French, Danish and some Italian — I love languages and wouldn't mind learning more!
