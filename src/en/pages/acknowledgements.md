## Technical

This site is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) (of which I am an official supporter!), a fantastic static site generator. I used [Dan Urbanowicz's boilerplate](https://templates.netlify.com/template/eleventy-netlify-boilerplate/) as a starting point. I run [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) in front of my build to compile my Sass to CSS and minify styles and scripts alike.

Hosting is provided by [Netlify](https://netlify.com/), free of charge, since I don't generate much traffic… Still good to support these fine folks, though!

## Aesthetics

Thanks for all the designers who create '80s-infused visuals that fuelled my inspiration. You provide invaluable visuals to the world.

The font used for headings is the beautiful [Marvin Visions Bold](https://www.readvisions.com/marvin) (free for personal use), that perfectly fit this site's aesthetic. The other fonts you see here are your system's default — yay, performance!

## Uses

I use a [2019 16" MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-16/) with pretty basic options: Intel Core i7, 16 GB RAM and 500 GB SSD storage. It's a fantastic computer, and I am so happy to have an Escape key after all these years with the virtual key.

In terms of software, I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the shiny [SynthWave '84 theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode) and a few extensions, such as [Bracket Pair Colorizer 2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2), or my own [VisuBezier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chriskirknielsen.visubezier). I also use quite a bit of [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) for my vector needs, cleaned up with [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) and then made _just right_ with manual tweaks.

While my tiny apartment doesn't allow much other than a small [IKEA Micke desk](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/micke-desk-black-brown-20244747/), I'd definitely recommend the [Autonomous AI ErgoChair 2](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/ergonomic-chair/?rid=7a4b2c) (contains a referral ID for a discount!). I also use the [Sony MDR-XB50AP in-ear headphones](https://www.sony.com/electronics/in-ear-headphones/mdr-xb50ap) for "convenient" audio listening, or the [Sony MDR-XB950N1 over-ear headphones](https://www.sony.com/electronics/headband-headphones/mdr-xb950n1) for more "focused" listening (noise-cancelling is nice).

## People

Thanks to my friend Youcef for giving me feedback every single time I asked him if a pixel looked out of place.

And thanks to my wife Ilona for dealing with me every time I said "One second, just fixing a thing on my website!", even though it took me half an hour.

Finally: thank **you** for stopping by, I truly appreciate it!
