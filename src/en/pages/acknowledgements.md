## Technical

This site is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) (of which I am an official supporter!), a fantastic static site generator. I used [Dan Urbanowicz's boilerplate](https://templates.netlify.com/template/eleventy-netlify-boilerplate/) as a starting point. I run [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) in front of my build to compile my Sass to CSS and minify styles and scripts alike, then inline them to reduce HTTP requests.

Hosting is provided by [Netlify](https://netlify.com/), free of charge, since I don't generate much traffic… Still good to support these fine folks, though!

## Aesthetics

Thanks to all the designers who create '80s-infused visuals that fuelled my inspiration. You provide invaluable visuals to the world.

The font used for headings is the beautiful [Marvin Visions Bold](https://www.readvisions.com/marvin) (free for personal use), that perfectly fits this site's aesthetic. The other fonts you see here are your system's default — yay, performance!

## Uses

### Gear

- [2019 16" MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-16/) (Intel Core i7, 16 GB RAM and 500 GB SSD)
    A good computer with a real Escape key, after all these years with a virtual one.

- [Autonomous AI ErgoChair 2](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/ergonomic-chair/?rid=7a4b2c) _(disclaimer: contains a referral ID, gives you a discount)_
    I think they recently renamed this to be ErgoChair Pro but it's a **good** chair.
- [Fully's Remi Standing Desk](https://www.fully.com/standing-desks/remi-standing-desk.html)
    I sit a lot, so having a desk that easily goes from sitting to standing is really helpful.
- [ErGear Dual Monitor Arms](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085Y4HW8S?linkCode=as2&tag=ratcgala-20)
    Frees up some space on my desk with easily adjusted position, good stuff.
- [Sony MDR-XB50AP in-ear headphones](https://www.sony.com/electronics/in-ear-headphones/mdr-xb50ap)
    Simple, reliable earbuds for "casual" audio listening, and useful for video meetings.

    Quality earphones for more "focused" listening, with noise-cancelling.

### Apps

- [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
    I've been using Firefox since version 3 or something, and it's never disappointed me — love the DevTools!
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    Love how powerful and extendable this editor is! I notably use these additions:
    - [SynthWave '84](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode): A beautiful neon-infused theme.
    - [Bracket Pair Colorizer 2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2): A useful way to keep track of indentation.

- [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html)
    I love working with vectors! I optimise my work with [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) and then manually tweak them to be _just right_.
- [Fork](https://fork.dev/)
    A little git tool that helps me avoid making big mistakes.
- [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac)
    Beautiful tool to compress images better, you won't regret it.

## People

Thanks to my friend Youcef for giving me feedback every single time I asked him if a pixel looked out of place.

And thanks to my wife Ilona for dealing with me every time I said "One second, just fixing a thing on my website!", even though it took me half an hour.

Finally: thank **you** for stopping by, I truly appreciate it!
