## Technical
This site is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a fantastic static site generator. I used [Dan Urbanowicz's boilerplate](https://templates.netlify.com/template/eleventy-netlify-boilerplate/) as a starting point.

Hosting is provided by [Netlify](https://netlify.com/), free of charge, since I don't generate much trafficâ€¦ Still good to support these fine folks, though!

While I edit most of this on VS Code, I do run [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) for quick content edits (since I run Gulp to compile my Sass files in front of my 11ty build).

## Aesthetics

Thanks for all the designers who create '80s-infused visuals that fueled my inspiration.

The font used for headings is the beautiful [Marvin Visions Bold](https://www.readvisions.com/marvin) (free for personal use), that perfectly fit this site's aesthetic.

Many non-brand icons you see on this site were provided by the excellent [ICONSVG](https://iconsvg.xyz/). The rest is custom work I made in Illustrator, and cleaned up for SVG (likely using [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/))!

## People

Thanks to my friend Youcef for giving me feedback every single time I asked him if a pixel looked out of place.

And thanks to my wife Ilona for dealing with me every time I said "One second, just fixing a thing on my website!", even though it took me half an hour.

I also thank you for stopping by, I appreciate it!
