Here's a quick tip if you have your content limited to a certain width but you want an element to "break out".

I've seen a few ways to do this, including one with `transform` which works great, but I ran into a case where I needed that `transform` for some animation. You can instead make use of relative positioning to achieve the same result.

Say you have a `.container` class with a `max-width` value and `margin: 0 auto`:

```css
.container {
  max-width: 48em;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

You can break an element out of this container by making it take up the whole screen's width (`100vw`), then move it left by `50%` of the container (which is the middle of the screen), minus half the screen's width (`50vw`), effectively placing it on the very first horizontal pixel of the viewport.

```css
.breakout {
  position: relative;
  left: calc(50% - 50vw);
  width: 100vw;
}
```

**That's all you need for this trick to work.** However, you might want to improve this a bit, so let's go a bit further.

## Improvements

You should also add `overflow-x: hidden` to the `body` (or a main wrapper around your container that takes up 100% of the width) to help with breakout elements that might eat up extra space for the vertical scrollbar on some browsers/operating systems.

```css
.main {
  overflow-x: hidden;
  width: 100%;
}
```

Note that if you want to really push the backward compatibility, in order to avoid a broken layout for the few browsers that support the `vw` unit but not `calc()`, you can use any variation of `calc(50vw * 2)` that results in `100vw`. This will ensure older browsers won't have content outside the viewport.

As a bonus, if you want to avoid having an absurdly large content on an ultra-wide viewport, you can restrict the max-width with two methods.

### First method: Container

This method involves wrapping the content in an element. Doing this will allow us to assign a maximum width and horizontally align the block in the middle:

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="breakout">
    <div class="breakout--content">
      Centred content goes here‚Ä¶
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.breakout--content {
	max-width: 80em;
	margin: 0 auto;
}
```

### Second method: Dynamic Padding

This `calc` value will take the screen width (`100vw`) minus the maximum width of the content you give it (let's say `80em`) and divide the result by `2`. The block will still take up all the horizontal space but the content will remain at a reasonable width.

If the screen width is equal to `80em`, the padding will compute to `0`, but if `100vw` is worth `100em`, the padding will evaluate to `(100em - 80em) / 2 = 10em` on each side. Note that `box-sizing: border-box;` is necessary to ensure the padding is subtracted from the full viewport width instead of added to it.

```css
* { box-sizing: border-box; }

.breakout--contained {
  padding-inline: calc((100vw - 80em) / 2);
  /* Logical property, equivalent to setting this value to padding-left and padding-right in left-to-right contexts */
}
```

{% callout %}
  A media query is not necessary since negative padding values are invalid. üëç
{% endcallout %}

Let's have a look at the complete code all together now:
