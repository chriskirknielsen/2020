When I converted [my blog, Geekometric](https://geekometric.com), from a WordPress-based site to a Hugo-built static site, I felt I needed to go through a lot of different pages to achieve a simple blog.

This tutorial is the result of my compilation of all the knowledge I gathered, or needed to gather, to achieve my goal of a Hugo blog, hosted on Netlify. There are a lot of steps but at the end, you'll have all the information you need to make it work, including hosting, domain handling, and even a CMS to edit your content via an online user interface!
