I wrote an article on CSS-Tricks about using a `--var: ;` [trick from Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me/2020/10/the-var-space-hack-to-toggle-multiple-values-with-one-custom-property/) to define theme variables only once, when you need to respect a user-preference media query as well as CSS classes. Since you can't do both in a single declaration block, you usually repeat these theme variablesâ€¦ but with this little hack, no need!

```css
--color: var(--light, orchid) var(--dark, rebeccapurple);
```

The article details the trick and how to set it up (because it _does_ look weird at first glance), maybe you'll find another use case for it!
